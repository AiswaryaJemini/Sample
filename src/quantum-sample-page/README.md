# Quantum sample demo
An example on how to build you own page with custom styling and scripting. Additionally this example demonstrates how to submit a form to Sitefinity.

## Sitefinity setup

In order to run this sample, you must setup the quantum sample found [here](https://github.com/Sitefinity/Telerik.Sitefinity.Samples.Quantum/tree/renderer-demo#net-core-renderer-setup)

Once you have everything set-upped, you should see a page called "Quantum sample page" with the label "new-editor". Navigate to that page
on the backend and frontend to view it.
