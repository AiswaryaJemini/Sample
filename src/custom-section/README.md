# Custom section sample
This sample demonstrates how to setup a custom section component that can have static placeholders defined in the html. In this example there are four different views that illustrate the different behavior of the placeholder tags when decorated with the specific classes - Container, ContainerFluid, Mixed placeholders and hardcoded three placeholders with the same width.

## Passing data from parent to child component
This sample additionally demonstrates how you can pass data from a parent section widget to a child. This is done through working with the ICompositeViewComponentContext interface. Using the interface we are passing additional data to the child components through the use of the 'Properties' property on each of the child widgets. For reference see the [static section widget](./ViewComponents/StaticSectionViewComponent.cs) and the view of the [ChildViewComonent](./Views/Shared/Components/Child/Default.cshtml)
