# Custom section sample
This sample demonstrates how to setup a custom section component that can have static placeholders defined in the html. In this example there are four different views that illustrate the diffrent behaviour of the placeholder tags when decorated with the specific classes - Contianer, ContainerFluid, Mixed placeholders and hardcoded three placeholders with the same width.
